### Question 1:
An array with an odd number of elements is said to be centered if all elements (except the middle one) are strictly greater than the value of the middle element. Note that only arrays with an odd number of elements have a middle element. Write a function that accepts an integer array and returns 1 if it is a centered array, otherwise it returns 0.

### Question 2:
Write a function that takes an array of integers as an argument and returns a value based on the sums of the even and odd numbers in the array. Let X = the sum of the odd numbers in the array and let Y = the sum of the even numbers. The function should return X â€“ Y
The signature of the function is:
